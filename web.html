    <h3><b>Dear Kayley,</b></h3>
        <p>How are you? I hope you are doing well. I have a lot of things to tell you
            <br/> about my day, but I also want to hear about yours. Thank you for always being there for me,
            <br/> and thank you for being my best friend. I hope we would last for more than 6 years.
            <br/> Let us make more memories and go on adventures together. See you soon! 
            <br/> <br/> Your <small>shortie</small> <i>bestie</i>,
